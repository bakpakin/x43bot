# x43bot

A simple IRC bot I made for my own amusement. Unleash it on channels to bother your enemies or
entertain your friends. Does not much out of the box, but you can "poke" it with

```
bakpakin | x43bot: poke
  x43bot | Hey, stop that!
```

## Install

Make sure to have libuv installed on your system. You can also use `jpm clear-cache`
if the install does not work the first time. This will get rid of any out-of-date
installed dependencies.

```
[sudo] jpm install https://github.com/bakpakin/x43bot.git
```

## Running

Use the -h flag to see options.

```
x43bot -h
```

## Credits

Inspired by https://git.sr.ht/~technomancy/pengbot, although no code from there.
